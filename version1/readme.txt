Version 1 PCB -- Coming Soon

I am currently developing a version of this circuit that is self contained and powered off a single 1S lipo battery, unfortunately the 12V boost circuit has been causing a number of difficulties and is not capable of properly powering the monitor. I will be making the necessary changes over the next few weeks and hopefully will have a working revision soon. Stay tuned for updates.
