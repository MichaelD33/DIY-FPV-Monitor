Custom FPV Monitor PCB version 1

This is a very simple circuit for receiving FPV video transmissions on the 5.8GHz amateur radio band. 


The code for this setup was pulled from sheivey's RX5808 Pro Diversity project, commonly used for commercial FPV recievers such as the LaForge Diversity module.
I disabled the diversity option to simplify the circuit and keep the design single sided so that I could etch the circuit at home using a laser engraver and common household chemicals.
